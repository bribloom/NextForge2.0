Example: `let name = 'Alice';`\n2. **Number**: Represents numeric values, both integers and floating-point numbers. Example: `let age = 30;`\n3. **Boolean**: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` or `false`. Example: `let isStudent = true;`\n4. **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. Example: `let value = null;`\n5. **Undefined**: Indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. Example: `let x;`\n6. **Symbol**: A unique and immutable value primarily used as object property keys. Example: `let sym = Symbol('description');`\n7. **BigInt**: Represents integers with arbitrary precision. Example: `let bigNumber = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;`"

Example: `let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];`\n3. **Function**: A block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions are also objects in JavaScript. Example: `function greet() { return 'Hello'; }`\n4. **Date**: Represents dates and times.
